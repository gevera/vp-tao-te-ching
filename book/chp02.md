All under heaven see beauty as beauty only because they also see ugliness.<br/>
All announce that good is good only because they also denounce what is bad.<br/>

Therefore, something and nothing give birth to one another.<br/>
Difficult and easy complete one another.<br/>
Long and short fashion one another.<br/>
High and low arise from one another.<br/>
Notes and tones harmonise with one another.<br/>
Front and back follow one another.<br/>

Thus, the True Person acts without striving and teaches without words.<br/>

Deny nothing to the ten thousand things.<br/>

Nourish them without claiming authority,<br/>
Benefit them without demanding gratitude,<br/>
Do the work, then move on.<br/>

And, the fruits of your labour will last forever.<br/>
