While carrying your active life on your head<br/>
can you embrace the quiet spirit in your arms, and not let go?<br/>
While being fully focused on your vital breath<br/>
can you make it soft like that of a newborn babe?<br/>
While cleaning your inner mirror<br/>
can you leave it without blemish?<br/>
While loving the people and ruling the country<br/>
can you dispense with cleverness?<br/>
While opening and closing the gates of heaven<br/>
can you be like a mother bird?<br/>
While penetrating the four quarters with your insight<br/>
can you remain simple?<br/>

Help the people live!<br/>
Nourish the people!<br/>

Help them live yet lay no claim to them.<br/>
Benefit them yet seek no gratitude.<br/>
Guide them yet do not control them.<br/>
This is called the hidden Virtue.<br/>
