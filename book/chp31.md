Weapons are ill-omened things.<br/>

Among gentle people the left side is the place of honour when at home,<br/>
but in war the right side is the place of honour.<br/>

Weapons are not proper instruments for gentle people;<br/>
they use them only when they have no other choice.<br/>
Peace and quiet are what they value.<br/>
They do not glory in victory.<br/>
to glorify it is to delight in the slaughter of people.<br/>
Those who delight in the slaughter of people will<br/>
never thrive among all that dwell under heaven.<br/>

The army that has killed people should be received with sorrow.<br/>
Conquerors should be received with the rites of mourning.<br/>
