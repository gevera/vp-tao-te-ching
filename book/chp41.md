The wise student on hearing the Tao diligently puts it into practice.<br/>
The average student on hearing the Tao keeps it one minute and loses it the next.<br/>
The mediocre student on hearing the Tao laughs at it loudly.<br/>
If this student did not laugh it would not be the Tao.<br/>

Therefore, the ancient proverb says:<br/>

The bright path seems dull.<br/>
The path that goes toward seems to lead backward.<br/>
The even path seems up and down.<br/>
The greatest whiteness seems soiled.<br/>

High Virtue seems like a canyon.<br/>
Abundant Virtue seems deficient.<br/>
Vigorous Virtue seems limp.<br/>
Simple Virtue seems faded.<br/>

The greatest square has no corners.<br/>
The greatest vessel takes long to complete.<br/>
The greatest note is hard to hear.<br/>
The greatest image has no shape.<br/>

The Tao is hidden and nameless;<br/>
yet, it is the Tao alone that supports all things<br/>
and brings them to completion.<br/>
