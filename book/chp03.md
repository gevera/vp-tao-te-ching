Not exalting the talented prevents rivalry.<br/>
Not valuing goods that are hard to obtain prevents stealing.<br/>
Not displaying desirable things prevents confusion of the heart.<br/>

Therefore, the True Person governs by emptying the heart of desire<br/>
and filling the belly with food, weakening ambitions and strengthening bones.<br/>

If the people are simple and free from desire, then the clever ones never dare to interfere.<br/>

Practise action without striving and all will be in order.<br/>
