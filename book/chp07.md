Heaven and earth last forever.<br/>
The reason why heaven and earth last forever<br/>
is that they do not live for themselves.<br/>
Hence, they last forever.<br/>

Therefore, the True Person leaves self behind<br/>
and thus is found in front,<br/>
is not guarded and thus is preserved,<br/>
is self-free and thus is able to find fulfilment.<br/>
