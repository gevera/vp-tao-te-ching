In the pursuit of learning, every day something is added.<br/>
In the pursuit of the Tao, every day something is dropped.<br/>

Less and less is done until you come to action without striving.<br/>
When you follow this practice, nothing remains undone.<br/>

All under heaven is won by letting things take their course.<br/>
Nothing can be gained by interfering.<br/>
