The Tao is forever nameless.<br/>

Though the Uncarved Block is small,<br/>
it is not inferior to anything under heaven.<br/>
If leaders could keep hold of it,<br/>
the ten thousand things would submit to them freely.<br/>
Heaven and earth would unite and sweet dew would fall.<br/>
The people would live in harmony without any law or decree.<br/>

Only when the Block is carved are there names.<br/>
As soon as there are names it is time to stop.<br/>
Knowing when to stop prevents trouble.<br/>
All under heaven will return to the Tao<br/>
as brooks and streams flow home to the sea.<br/>
