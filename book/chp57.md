Govern the country by being straightforward.<br/>
Wage war by being crafty.<br/>
Win all under heaven by not meddling.<br/>

How do I know that this is so?<br/>
By what is within me.<br/>

The more restrictions there are, the poorer are the people.<br/>
The more pointed the peopleâ€™s weapons, the more disorder there is in the country.<br/>
The more ingenious and clever the people, the more strange the contrivances that appear.<br/>
The more laws and edicts that are posted, the more thieves and robbers that arise.<br/>

Hence an Old One has said:<br/>
I act without striving and the people transform themselves.<br/>
I love stillness and the people straighten themselves.<br/>
I do not meddle and the people prosper by themselves.<br/>
I am free from desires and the people themselves<br/>
return to the simplicity of the Uncarved Block.<br/>
