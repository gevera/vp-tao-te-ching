The way of heaven is like the bending of a bow.<br/>
The high end is pulled down and the low end is raised up.<br/>
The excessive is diminished and the deficient is supplemented.<br/>

It is the way of heaven to take where there is too much<br/>
in order to give where there is not enough.<br/>
The way of people is otherwise.<br/>
They take where there is not enough<br/>
in order to increase where there is already too much.<br/>
Who will take from their own excesses<br/>
and give to all under heaven?<br/>
Only those who hold to the Tao.<br/>

Therefore, the True Person benefits yet expects no reward,<br/>
does the work and moves on.<br/>
There is no desire to be considered better than others.<br/>
