The Great Virtue is to follow the Tao and only the Tao.<br/>

The Tao is shadowy and intangible.<br/>
Intangible and evasive, and yet within it is a form.<br/>
Evasive and intangible, and yet within it is a substance.<br/>
Shadowy and dark, and yet within it is a vital force.<br/>
This vital force is real and can be relied upon.<br/>

From ancient times to the present the Taoâ€™s instructions have not been forgotten.<br/>
Through it can be perceived the beginning of the story of life.<br/>
How do I know how it was at the beginning of the story of life?<br/>

Because of what is within me.<br/>
