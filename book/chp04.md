The Tao is like an empty bowl, yet it may be used without ever needing to be filled.<br/>
It is the deep and unfathomable source of the ten thousand things.<br/>

Blunt the sharpness.<br/>
Untie the knot.<br/>
Soften the glare.<br/>
Settle with the dust.<br/>

It is hidden deep yet ever present.<br/>
I do not know whose child it is.<br/>
It existed before the common ancestor.<br/>
