Everyone under heaven says my Tao is great<br/>
and resembles nothing else.<br/>
It is because it is great that it seems different.<br/>
If it were like anything on earth<br/>
it would have been small from the beginning.<br/>

I have three treasures that I cherish and hold fast.<br/>
The first is gentleness,<br/>
the second is simplicity,<br/>
the third is daring not to be first<br/>
among all things under heaven.<br/>
Because of gentleness I am able to be courageous.<br/>
Because of simplicity I am able to be generous.<br/>
Because of daring not to be first<br/>
I am able to lead.<br/>

If people forsake gentleness and attempt to be courageous,<br/>
forsake simplicity and attempt to be generous,<br/>
forsake the last place and attempt to get the first place,<br/>
this is certain death.<br/>

Gentleness conquers in battle and protects in defence.<br/>
What heaven guards, it arms with the gift of gentleness.<br/>
