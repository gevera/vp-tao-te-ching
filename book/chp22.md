Yield and overcome; bend and be straight.<br/>
Empty out and be full; wear out and be renewed.<br/>
Have little and gain; have much and be confused.<br/>

Therefore, the True Person embraces the One<br/>
and becomes a model for all.<br/>

Do not look only at yourself, and you will see much.<br/>
Do not justify yourself, and you will be distinguished.<br/>
Do not brag, and you will have merit.<br/>
Do not be prideful, and your work will endure.<br/>

It is because you do not strive that no one under heaven can strive with you.<br/>

The saying of the Old Ones, “Yield and Overcome,” is not an empty phrase.<br/>
True wholeness is achieved by blending with life.<br/>
