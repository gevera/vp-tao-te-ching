Heaven and earth are not moved by offerings of straw-dogs.<br/>
The True Person is not moved by offerings of straw-dogs.<br/>

The space between heaven and earth is like a bellows.<br/>
It is empty and yet never exhausted.<br/>
The more it works the more comes out.<br/>

Many words lead to exhaustion.<br/>
Better to hold fast to your centre.<br/>
