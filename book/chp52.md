# 52

All things under heaven had a common beginning,<br/>
and that beginning could be considered<br/>
the Mother of all things.<br/>
When you know the Mother<br/>
you will also know the children.<br/>
Know the children, yet hold fast to the Mother,<br/>
and to the end of your days<br/>
you will be free from danger.<br/>

Block the passages!<br/>
Shut the doors!<br/>
And, to the end of your days<br/>
your strength will not fail you.<br/>
Open the passages!<br/>
Increase your activities!<br/>
And, to the end of your days<br/>
you will be beyond help.<br/>

See the small and develop clear vision.<br/>
Practise yielding and develop strength.<br/>
Use the outer light to return to the inner light,<br/>
and save yourself from harm.<br/>

This is known as following the Always-so.<br/>
