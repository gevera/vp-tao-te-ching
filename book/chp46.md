When the Tao prevails in the world<br/>
swift horses are used to fertilise the fields.<br/>
When the Tao is unheeded<br/>
war horses are bred on the border lands.<br/>

There is no greater offence than harbouring desires.<br/>
There is no greater disaster than discontent.<br/>
There is no greater misfortune than wanting more.<br/>

Hence, if you are content<br/>
You will always have enough.<br/>
