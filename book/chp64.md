Peace is easily maintained while things are still at rest.<br/>
Trouble is easily handled before it starts.<br/>
What is brittle is easily broken.<br/>
What is minute is easily scattered.<br/>

Handle a problem before it appears.<br/>
Secure order before confusion begins.<br/>

A tree as big as a personâ€™s embrace begins as a tiny shoot.<br/>
A terrace nine stories high rises from a shovelful of earth.<br/>
A journey of a thousand miles begins under your feet.<br/>

A person who interferes does harm,<br/>
and those who grasp lose their hold.<br/>
Therefore, the True Person acts without striving and does no harm,<br/>
avoids grabbing and never loses hold.<br/>

People often ruin their ventures when they are on the verge of success.<br/>
So, be as careful at the end as at the beginning, and your work will not be ruined.<br/>

Therefore, the True Person seeks freedom from desire,<br/>
does not value things that are hard to come by,<br/>
learns without scholarship,<br/>
brings people back to what they have passed by,<br/>
and assists the ten thousand things to find their own natures;<br/>
all without daring to interfere.<br/>
