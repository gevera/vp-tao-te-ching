When the people lack a sense of awe<br/>
disaster will descend upon them.<br/>

Do not constrict their living space.<br/>
Do not harass them in their work.<br/>
If you do not oppress them, they will not weary of you.<br/>

Therefore, True Persons know themselves<br/>
but make no show of themselves.<br/>
They know their value<br/>
but do not exalt themselves.<br/>
They prefer this within to that without.<br/>
