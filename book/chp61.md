A great country is like the low lands<br/>
where all the streams unite.<br/>

In all things under heaven<br/>
the female overcomes the male by her stillness,<br/>
and because she is still she lies below.<br/>

Hence, if the great country will take the low place<br/>
it will win over the little country.<br/>
If the little country will take the low place<br/>
it will win over the great country.<br/>

Thus, the one gets below and prospers<br/>
and the other remains below and prospers.<br/>
All that the great country wants is more people.<br/>

All that the little country wants is a place<br/>
for its people to go and to be employed.<br/>
If each is to get what it wants<br/>
it is necessary for the great country<br/>
to take the low place.<br/>
