The best leader is one whose existence is barely known by the people.<br/>
Next comes one whom they love and praise.<br/>
Next comes one they fear.<br/>
Next comes one they defy.<br/>

If you do not trust enough, you will not be trusted.<br/>

True Persons do not offer words lightly.<br/>
When their task is accomplished<br/>
and their work is completed,<br/>
the people say, “It happened to us naturally.”<br/>
