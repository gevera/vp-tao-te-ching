A person who is filled with Virtue is like a newborn child.<br/>
Poisonous insects will not sting, wild animals will not pounce,<br/>
birds of prey will not swoop down.<br/>
Although bones are soft and sinews weak, a child’s grip is firm.<br/>
The union of man and woman is not known,<br/>
yet there is completeness,<br/>
because a child’s vital force is at its height.<br/>
Crying all day will not produce hoarseness,<br/>
because there is perfect harmony.<br/>

To know harmony is to know the Always-so.<br/>
To know the Always-so is to be awakened.<br/>

Trying to fill life to the brim invites a curse.<br/>
For the mind to make demands upon the breath of life brings strain.<br/>

Whatever has been forced to a peak of vigour approaches its decay.<br/>
This is not the way of Tao.<br/>
And that which goes against the Tao will quickly pass away.<br/>
