Hold on to the Great Image and all under heaven will approach you.<br/>
Coming to you and not being harmed, they will find rest, peace, and security.<br/>

A passing guest will pause at the sound of music and the smell of fancy food.<br/>
By comparison the Tao is mild and flavourless.<br/>
It is not solid enough to be seen, nor loud enough to be heard.<br/>
Yet, it lasts forever.<br/>
