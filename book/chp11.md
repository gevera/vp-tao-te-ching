Thirty spokes connect to the wheelâ€™s hub;<br/>
yet, it is the centre hole that makes it useful.<br/>
Clay is shaped into a vessel;<br/>
yet, it is the emptiness within that makes it useful.<br/>
Doors and windows are cut for a room;<br/>
yet it is the space where there is nothing that makes it useful.<br/>

Therefore, though advantage comes from what is;<br/>
usefulness comes from what is not.<br/>
