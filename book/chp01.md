The Tao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Tao.<br/>
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.<br/>

The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth.<br/>
The name is the mother of the ten thousand things.<br/>

Send your desires away and you will see the mystery.<br/>
Be filled with desire and you will see only the manifestation.<br/>

As these two come forth they differ in name.<br/>

Yet at their source they are the same.<br/>
This source is called a mystery.<br/>

Darkness within darkness, the gateway to all mystery.<br/>
