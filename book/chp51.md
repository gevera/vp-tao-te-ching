The Tao gives life to all things,<br/>
and its Virtue nourishes them,<br/>
forms each according to its nature<br/>
and gives to each its inner strength.<br/>

Therefore, the ten thousand things all venerate the Tao and honour its Virtue.<br/>
It has never been decreed that the Tao be venerated and its Virtue be honoured;<br/>
they have always been so treated spontaneously.<br/>

Thus, the Tao gives life to all things;<br/>
and its Virtue raises them, nourishes them,<br/>
brings them to their full growth,<br/>
feeds, shelters, and protects them.<br/>

Giving life without claiming authority,<br/>
benefiting without demanding gratitude,<br/>
guiding without control.<br/>
This is called hidden Virtue.<br/>
