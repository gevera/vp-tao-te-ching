Empty everything out; hold fast to your stillness.<br/>
Even though all things are stirring together,<br/>
watch for the movement of return.<br/>
The ten thousand things flourish and then<br/>
each returns to the root from which it came.<br/>
Returning to the root is stillness.<br/>
Through stillness each fulfils its destiny.<br/>
That which has fulfilled its destiny<br/>
becomes part of the Always-so.<br/>
To be aware of the Always-so is to awaken.<br/>

Those who innovate while in ignorance of the Always-so<br/>
move toward disaster.<br/>
Those who act with awareness of the Always-so<br/>
embrace all, are not possessed by particular desire,<br/>
and move toward the Tao.<br/>
Those who are at one with the Tao abide forever.<br/>
Even after their bodies waste away, they are safe and whole.<br/>
