If you would assist leaders of people by way of the Tao,<br/>
you will oppose the use of armed force to overpower the world.<br/>

Those who use weapons will be harmed by them.<br/>
Where troops have camped only thorn bushes grow.<br/>
Bad harvests follow in the wake of a great army.<br/>

The skilful person strikes the blow and stops,<br/>
without taking advantage of victory.<br/>
Bring it to a conclusion but do not be vain.<br/>
Bring it to a conclusion but do not be boastful.<br/>
Bring it to a conclusion but do not be arrogant.<br/>
Bring it to a conclusion but only when there is no choice.<br/>
Bring it to a conclusion but without violence.<br/>

When force is used, youthful strength decays.<br/>
This is not the way of Tao.<br/>
And that which goes against the Tao will quickly pass away.<br/>
