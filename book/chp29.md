Whoever wishes to take over the world will not succeed.<br/>
The world is a sacred vessel and nothing should be done to it.<br/>
Whoever tries to tamper with it will mar it.<br/>
Whoever tries to grab it will lose it.<br/>

Hence, there is a time to go ahead and a time to stay behind.<br/>
There is a time to breathe easy and a time to breathe hard.<br/>
There is a time to be vigorous and a time to be gentle.<br/>
There is a time to gather and a time to release.<br/>

Therefore, the True Person avoids extremes, self-indulgence, and extravagance.<br/>
