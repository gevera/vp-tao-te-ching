The True Person does not have an individual heart<br/>
but uses the heart of the people.<br/>
I am kind to those who are kind.<br/>
I am also kind to those who are not kind.<br/>
Thus, there is an increase in kindness.<br/>
I keep faith with those who are in good faith.<br/>
I also keep faith with those who lack good faith.<br/>
Thus, there is an increase of good faith.<br/>

The True Person is detached and humble<br/>
and to the world appears confusing.<br/>
The people all strain their eyes and ears,<br/>
yet the True Person remains childlike.<br/>
