The most yielding of all things overcomes the hardest of all things.<br/>
That which has no substance enters where there is no crevice.<br/>

Hence, I know the value of action without striving.<br/>

Few things under heaven bring more benefit than<br/>
the lessons learned from silence and<br/>
the actions taken without striving.<br/>
