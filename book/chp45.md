Great accomplishment seems incomplete, yet its use is not impaired.<br/>
Great fullness seems empty, yet it will never be drained.<br/>

Great straightness looks crooked.<br/>
Great skill appears clumsy.<br/>
Great eloquence sounds like stammering.<br/>

Movement overcomes cold, stillness overcomes heat.<br/>
The calm and quiet set right everything under heaven.<br/>
