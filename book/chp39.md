From ancient times these things have arisen from the One:<br/>

Heaven is clear because of the One,<br/>
The earth is firm because of the One,<br/>
The Spirit is strong because of the One,<br/>
The valley is full because of the One,<br/>
The ten thousand things reproduce because of the One,<br/>
Leaders are able to lead because of the One.<br/>

All of this comes from the One.<br/>

If heaven were not clear it would soon split.<br/>
If the earth were not firm it would soon bend and break.<br/>
If the Spirit were not strong it would soon wear out.<br/>
If the valley were not full it would soon dry up.<br/>
If the ten thousand things did not reproduce they would soon die out.<br/>
If leaders could not lead they would soon fall.<br/>

Therefore, greatness has its source in the little.<br/>
The low is the foundation of the high.<br/>

Princes call themselves “alone,” “helpless,” “worthless.”<br/>
Is this not acknowledging a humble root?<br/>

Enumerate the parts of a carriage and you have not defined a carriage.<br/>
Better to resound like stone chimes than to tinkle like jade bells.<br/>
