The great Tao covers everything like a flood.<br/>
It flows to the left and to the right.<br/>
The ten thousand things depend upon it<br/>
and it denies none of them.<br/>
It accomplishes its task yet claims no reward.<br/>
It clothes and feeds the ten thousand things<br/>
yet it does not attempt to control them.<br/>
Therefore, it may be called “the little.”<br/>

The ten thousand things return to it,<br/>
even though it does not control them.<br/>
Therefore, it may be called “the great.”<br/>

So it is that the True Person does not wish to be great<br/>
and therefore becomes truly great.<br/>
