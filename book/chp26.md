The solid must be the root of the light.<br/>
The still must be the master of the restless.<br/>

Therefore, wise people when travelling all day<br/>
do not lose sight of their baggage cart.<br/>
Although there are beautiful scenes to see,<br/>
they remain quietly in their own place.<br/>
Should a lord of ten thousand chariots<br/>
appear more frivolous than a simple traveller?<br/>

To be light is to lose the root.<br/>
To be restless is to lose the master.<br/>
