Your integrity or your body: Which is more important?<br/>
Your body or your possessions: Which is worth more?<br/>
Gain or loss: Which is more harmful?<br/>
Thus it is that the miser will pay much.<br/>
The hoarder will suffer great loss.<br/>
Be content with what you have and you will not be disgraced.<br/>
Know when to stop and you will be preserved from danger.<br/>
Only in this way will you long endure.<br/>
