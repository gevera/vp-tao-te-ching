The master soldiers have a saying:<br/>
I dare not be the host but prefer to be the guest.<br/>
I dare not advance an inch but prefer to retreat a foot.<br/>

This is called marching without moving,<br/>
rolling up a sleeve without baring an arm,<br/>
capturing a foe without a battlefront,<br/>
arming yourself without weapons.<br/>

There is no disaster greater than attacking and finding no enemy.<br/>
Doing so will cost you your treasure.<br/>
Thus it is that when opposing forces meet,<br/>
victory will go to those who take no delight in the situation.<br/>
