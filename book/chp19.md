Stop being learned and your troubles will end.<br/>

Give up wisdom, discard cleverness,<br/>
and the people will benefit a hundredfold.<br/>

Give up benevolence, discard moral judgements,<br/>
and the people will rediscover natural compassion.<br/>

Give up shrewdness, discard gain,<br/>
and thieves and robbers will disappear.<br/>

These three false adornments are not enough to live by.<br/>
They must give way to something more solid.<br/>
Look for what is simple and hold onto the Uncarved Block.<br/>
Diminish thoughts of self and restrain desires.<br/>
