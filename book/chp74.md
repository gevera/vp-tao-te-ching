When the people do not fear death,<br/>
of what use is it to threaten them with death?<br/>
If the people were always afraid of death<br/>
and if those who did wrong<br/>
would always be arrested and put to death,<br/>
who would do wrong?<br/>

There is always a Lord of Execution whose duty it is to kill.<br/>
If you try to fill that function it is like trying to hew wood<br/>
in place of a master carpenter.<br/>
You will probably injure your own hands.<br/>
