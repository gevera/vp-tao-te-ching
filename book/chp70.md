My words are easy to understand and easy to put into practice.<br/>
Yet no one under heaven understands them or puts them into practice.<br/>

My words have an ancestor. My actions are governed.<br/>

Because people do not understand this<br/>
they do not understand me.<br/>
Those who understand me are few.<br/>
Those who follow me should be respected.<br/>

Therefore, the True Person wears homespun clothes<br/>
and carries jade in the heart.<br/>
