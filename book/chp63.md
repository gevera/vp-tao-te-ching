Act without striving.<br/>
Work without interfering.<br/>
Find the flavour in what is flavourless.<br/>

Enlarge the small, increase the few.<br/>
Heal injury with goodness.<br/>

Handle the difficult while it is still easy.<br/>
Cultivate the great while it is still small.<br/>

All difficult things begin as easy things.<br/>
All great things begin as small things.<br/>

Therefore, the True Person never attempts anything great,<br/>
and accomplishes great things.<br/>

Lightly made promises inspire little faith.<br/>
Trying to make things easy results in great difficulties.<br/>

Therefore, the True Person regards everything as difficult,<br/>
and is never overcome by difficulties.<br/>
