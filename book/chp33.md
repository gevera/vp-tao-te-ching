Knowing others is to be clever.<br/>
Knowing yourself is to be enlightened.<br/>
Overcoming others requires force.<br/>
Overcoming yourself requires strength.<br/>

To know that you have enough is to be rich.<br/>
Push through and you may get your way,<br/>
but return home and you will endure.<br/>
Live out your days and you have had a long life.<br/>
