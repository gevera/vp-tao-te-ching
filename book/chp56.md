Those who know do not speak.<br/>
Those who speak do not know.<br/>

Block the passages!<br/>
Shut the doors!<br/>
Blunt the sharpness!<br/>
Untangle the knots!<br/>
Soften the glare!<br/>
Settle with the dust!<br/>
This is the Mystery of Evenness.<br/>

Those who have achieved this cannot be enclosed<br/>
nor kept at a distance;<br/>
they cannot be benefited nor harmed,<br/>
honoured nor disgraced.<br/>

Therefore, this is the noblest state under heaven.<br/>
