Without going outside you can know the ways of the world.<br/>
Without looking through the window you can see the way of heaven.<br/>
The farther you go the less you know.<br/>

Therefore, the True Person<br/>
arrives without travelling,<br/>
perceives without looking,<br/>
and acts without striving.<br/>
