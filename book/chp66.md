How did the sea gain kingship of a hundred streams?<br/>
Because it takes the lower position.<br/>
Hence, it is king of a hundred streams.<br/>

Therefore, when True Persons are over the people<br/>
they put themselves below the people by their speech.<br/>
When they lead the people they stand behind the people.<br/>

When True Persons are given places above the people<br/>
they do not crush the people with their weight.<br/>
When they take their place ahead of the people<br/>
they do not obstruct the peopleâ€™s progress.<br/>
That is why everything under heaven supports them gladly<br/>
and does not tire of them.<br/>

Because they strive with no one,<br/>
no one can ever strive with them.<br/>
