When the great Tao is forgotten,<br/>
benevolence and moral codes arise.<br/>
When shrewdness and cleverness appear,<br/>
great hypocrisy follows.<br/>
When there is no harmony in the family,<br/>
filial manners are developed<br/>
When the country is in disorder,<br/>
ministers appear as loyal servants.<br/>
