At birth you are supple and soft.<br/>
At death you are stiff and hard.<br/>
Grass and trees are pliant and tender when living,<br/>
but they are dry and brittle when dead.<br/>
Therefore, the stiff and hard are attendants of death,<br/>
the supple and soft are attendants of life.<br/>

Thus, the hard weapon will be broken.<br/>
The mighty tree will invite the axe.<br/>

Therefore, the hard and mighty belong below;<br/>
the yielding and gentle belong above.<br/>
