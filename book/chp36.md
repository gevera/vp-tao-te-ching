That which is to be shrunk must first be stretched out.<br/>
That which is to be weakened must first be strengthened.<br/>
That which is to be cast down must first be raised up.<br/>
That which is to be taken must first be given.<br/>

There is wisdom in dimming your light.<br/>
For the soft and gentle will overcome the hard and powerful.<br/>

Fish are best left in deep waters.<br/>
And, weapons are best kept out of sight.<br/>
