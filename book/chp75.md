Why are the people starving?<br/>
Because their leaders eat up too much of the tax-grain;<br/>
that is why the people are starving.<br/>
Why are the people difficult to govern?<br/>
Because their leaders interfere;<br/>
that is why the people are difficult to govern.<br/>
Why do the people treat death lightly.<br/>
Because their leaders are so grossly absorbed in the pursuit of living;<br/>
that is why the people treat death lightly.<br/>

Indeed, it is wiser to ignore life altogether<br/>
than to place too high a value on it.<br/>
