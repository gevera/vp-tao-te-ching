A person of high virtue is not conscious of virtue and therefore possesses Virtue.<br/>
A person of little virtue tries to be virtuous and therefore lacks Virtue.<br/>
A person of high virtue does not make a fuss and is not seen.<br/>
A person of little virtue always makes a fuss and is always seen.<br/>
A truly good person functions without ulterior motive.<br/>
A moralist acts out of private desires.<br/>
A ritualist acts and, when no one responds, rolls up a sleeve and marches.<br/>

When we lose the Tao, we turn to Virtue.<br/>
When we lose Virtue, we turn to kindness.<br/>
When we lose kindness, we turn to morality.<br/>
When we lose morality, we turn to ritual.<br/>

Ritual is the mere husk of good faith and loyalty and the beginning of disorder.<br/>
Knowledge of what is to come may be a flower of the Tao, but it is the beginning of folly.<br/>

Hence, the well-formed person relies on what is solid and not on what is flimsy,<br/>
on the fruit and not the flower.<br/>
Therefore, such a person lets go of that without and is content with this within.<br/>
