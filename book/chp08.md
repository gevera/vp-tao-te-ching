The highest good is like water.<br/>
For water benefits the ten thousand things without striving.<br/>
It settles in places that people avoid and so is like the Tao.<br/>

In choosing your home look to the land.<br/>
In preparing your heart go deep.<br/>
In associating with others value gentleness.<br/>
In speaking exhibit good faith.<br/>
In governing provide good order.<br/>
In the conduct of business be competent.<br/>
In action be timely.<br/>

Then there is no strife, nothing goes amiss.<br/>
