# 80

In a small country with few people:<br/>
Though there are machines that would increase<br/>
production ten to a hundred miles<br/>
they are not used.<br/>
The people take death seriously and do not travel about.<br/>

Though they have boats and carriages no one uses them.<br/>
Though they have armour and weapons, there is no occasion to display them.<br/>

The people give up writing<br/>
and return to the knotting of cords.<br/>
They are satisfied with their food.<br/>
They are pleased with their clothes.<br/>
They are content with their homes.<br/>
They are happy in their simple ways.<br/>

Even though they live within sight of another country<br/>
and can hear dogs barking and cocks crowing in it,<br/>
still the people grow old and die<br/>
without ever coming into conflict.<br/>
