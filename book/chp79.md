Even though a truce is made between great enemies,<br/>
some enmity is bound to remain.<br/>
How can this be beneficial?<br/>

Therefore, the True Person<br/>
undertakes the obligations of the agreement<br/>
but makes no claim upon others.<br/>
The person who has Virtue shares with others.<br/>
The person who lacks Virtue takes from others.<br/>

The way of heaven has no favourites;<br/>
it always remains with what is good.<br/>
