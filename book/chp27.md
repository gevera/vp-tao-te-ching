A skilful traveller leaves no track.<br/>
A skilful speaker makes no slip.<br/>
A skilful reckoner needs no counting rod.<br/>
A skilfully made door requires no bolts, yet it cannot be opened.<br/>
A skilful binding has no cords or knots, yet it cannot be untied.<br/>

Therefore, the True Person<br/>
is skilful in assisting people,<br/>
and abandons nobody;<br/>
Is skilful in assisting things,<br/>
and abandons nothing.<br/>
This is called “Following the Inner Light.”<br/>

Therefore, the skilful person is the teacher<br/>
of the person without skill.<br/>
The person without skill is the material<br/>
for the skilful person.<br/>
If you do not respect the teacher,<br/>
if you do not care for the material,<br/>
you are on the road to confusion<br/>
and your cleverness will not save you.<br/>

This is an essential principle.<br/>
