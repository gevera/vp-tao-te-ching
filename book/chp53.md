If I have even little sense,<br/>
I will walk upon the great path of Tao<br/>
and only fear straying from it.<br/>
This Great Way is straight and smooth<br/>
yet people often prefer the side roads.<br/>

The courtyard is well kept<br/>
but the fields are full of weeds,<br/>
and the granaries stand empty.<br/>
Still, there are those of us<br/>
who wear elegant clothes, carry sharp swords,<br/>
pamper ourselves with food and drink<br/>
and have more possessions than we can use.<br/>
These are the actions of robbers.<br/>

This is certainly far from the Tao.<br/>
