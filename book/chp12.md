The five colours blind the eye.<br/>
The five notes deafen the ear.<br/>
The five flavours dull the palate.<br/>
Racing and hunting drive the heart wild.<br/>

Goods that are hard to obtain hinder the journey.<br/>
Therefore, the True Person<br/>
is guided more by the belly than the eye,<br/>
and prefers this within to that without.<br/>
