How great is the difference between “yea” and “yeah”?<br/>
How great is the distinction between “good” and “evil”?<br/>

Must I fear what others fear? How silly!<br/>

Everyone else is joyous as if enjoying the greatest feast,<br/>
or going up the terraces in spring.<br/>
I alone am drifting without direction, like a baby who has not yet smiled.<br/>
I alone am moping as if I had no home.<br/>
Everyone else has more than they need,<br/>
I alone seem in want.<br/>
I have the mind of a fool, how confused I am!<br/>
Other people are bright and clever,<br/>
I alone am dark.<br/>
Other people are alert and self-assured,<br/>
I alone am dull and muddled.<br/>
I am unsettled like the waves of the sea, like the restless wind.<br/>
Everyone else has a purpose,<br/>
I alone am stubborn and awkward.<br/>
I am different from other people,<br/>
Even so, I am nourished by the Great.<br/>
