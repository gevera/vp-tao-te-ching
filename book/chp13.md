Both favour and disgrace bring fear.<br/>
Great trouble comes from having a body.<br/>
What is meant by: “Both favour and disgrace bring fear”?<br/>
Favour leads to a fear of losing it and<br/>
disgrace leads to a fear of greater trouble.<br/>
What is meant by: “Great trouble comes from having a body”?<br/>
The reason you have trouble is that you are self-conscious.<br/>
No trouble can befall a self-free person.<br/>
Therefore, surrender your self-interest.<br/>
Love others as much as you love yourself.<br/>
Then you can be entrusted with all things under heaven.<br/>
