Better to stop in time than to fill to the brim.<br/>
Hone a blade to the sharpest point, and it will soon be blunt.<br/>
Fill your house with gold and jade, and no one can protect it.<br/>
Be prideful about wealth and position, and you bring disasters upon yourself.<br/>
Retire when the work is done.<br/>
This is the way of heaven.<br/>
