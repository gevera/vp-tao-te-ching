Something formless yet complete, existing before heaven and earth.<br/>
Silent and limitless, it stands alone and does not change.<br/>
Reaching everywhere, it does not tire.<br/>
Perhaps it is the Mother of all things under heaven.<br/>
I do not know its name so I call it “Tao.”<br/>

When I have to describe it I call it “great.”<br/>
Being great it flows.<br/>
It flows far away.<br/>
Having gone far away, it returns.<br/>

Therefore, the Tao is great.<br/>
Heaven is great.<br/>
Earth is great.<br/>
People are also great.<br/>
Thus, people constitute one of the<br/>
four great things of the universe.<br/>

People conform to the earth.<br/>
The earth conforms to heaven.<br/>
Heaven conforms to the Tao.<br/>
The Tao conforms to its own nature.<br/>
