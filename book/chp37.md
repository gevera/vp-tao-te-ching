The Tao never strives, yet nothing is left undone.<br/>
If leaders were able to adhere to it<br/>
the ten thousand things<br/>
would develop of their own accord.<br/>
If after they have developed<br/>
they experience desires to strive,<br/>
they can bury those desires<br/>
under the nameless Uncarved Block.<br/>

The nameless Uncarved Block can protect against desire.<br/>
When desires are restrained there will be peace,<br/>
and then all under heaven will be at rest.<br/>
