When going off one way means living<br/>
and going off the other way means dying,<br/>
three in ten are companions of Life,<br/>
three in ten are companions of Death, and<br/>
three in ten value Life but drift toward Death.<br/>

Why is all this so?<br/>
Because, these people are too greedy about living.<br/>

It is said:<br/>
People who are skilful in caring<br/>
for the life that has been given to them<br/>
travel abroad without fear of wild ox or tiger,<br/>
and enter a battle without concern for sharp weapons.<br/>
There is no place for the wild ox to thrust its horns,<br/>
there is no place for the tiger to put its claws,<br/>
there is no place for a weapon to lodge.<br/>

How is this so?<br/>
Because, there is no place for Death to enter in!<br/>
