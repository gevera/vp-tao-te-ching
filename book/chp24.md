The person on tiptoe is not steady.<br/>
The person with legs astride cannot walk.<br/>

Those who look only at themselves see little.<br/>
Those who justify themselves are not distinguished.<br/>
Those who brag have no merit.<br/>
The work of prideful people will not endure.<br/>

From the standpoint of the Tao, these things are<br/>
“excessive food and tumours of the body.”<br/>
As they bring sickness, followers of the Tao do not linger around them.<br/>
