Sincere words are not elegant; elegant words are not sincere.<br/>
The good person does not argue; the person who argues is not good.<br/>
The wise do not have great learning; those with great learning are not wise.<br/>
True Persons do not hoard.<br/>
Using all they have for others, they still have more.<br/>
Giving all they have to others, they are richer than before.<br/>
The way of heaven is to benefit and not to harm.<br/>
The way of the True Reason is to assist without striving<br/>
in the unfolding of the story of the earth.<br/>
