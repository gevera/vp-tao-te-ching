What is well rooted cannot be pulled up.<br/>
What is firmly grasped will not slip loose.<br/>
It will be honoured from generation to generation.<br/>

When cultivated in your person, Virtue will be real.<br/>
When cultivated in your household, Virtue will be plentiful.<br/>
When cultivated in your village, Virtue will endure.<br/>
When cultivated in your country, Virtue will abound.<br/>
When cultivated in your world, Virtue will be universal.<br/>

Hence, through yourself look at Self.<br/>
Through your household look at Household.<br/>
Through your community look at Community.<br/>
Through your country look at Country.<br/>
Through your world look at World.<br/>

How do I know that the world is like this?<br/>
Because of what is within me.<br/>
