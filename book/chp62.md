The Tao is to the ten thousand things<br/>
what the shrine is in the home.<br/>
It is the treasure of the virtuous<br/>
and the protection of the wrongdoer.<br/>

Good words are appreciated.<br/>
Good deeds are accepted as gifts.<br/>

Even the wrongdoers are not abandoned.<br/>

Hence, on the day an Emperor is installed<br/>
and appoints the three ducal ministers.<br/>
remain where you are and make an offering of the Tao.<br/>
It will be preferable to a gift of jade discs<br/>
followed by a team of four horses.<br/>
Why did the ancients value the Tao?<br/>
Was it not because through it<br/>
you can find what you seek,<br/>
and because of it<br/>
you can escape what is hounding you?<br/>

Therefore, it is the most valuable thing under heaven.<br/>
