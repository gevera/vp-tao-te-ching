Nothing under heaven is<br/>
softer or more yielding than water.<br/>
Yet it has no equal for attacking things<br/>
that are hard and stiff.<br/>
Nothing can withstand it.<br/>

Everyone knows that the yielding overcomes the stiff,<br/>
and the soft overcomes the hard.<br/>
Yet no one applies this knowledge.<br/>

Therefore, an Old One said:<br/>
Only a person who has accepted the country’s dirt<br/>
is a leader worthy to offer sacrifice<br/>
at its shrines of earth and grain.<br/>
Only a person who takes up the country’s burdens<br/>
deserves to be a leader<br/>
among those who dwell under heaven.<br/>

Straightforward words seem crooked.<br/>
