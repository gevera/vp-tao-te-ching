Governing a big country is like cooking a small fish.<br/>

Let all under heaven be governed in accordance with the Tao,<br/>
and demons will not manifest their power.<br/>
It is not that they lack power<br/>
but rather they will not use their power<br/>
to harm the people.<br/>
They are not the only ones who have power<br/>
and do not use it to harm the people.<br/>
The True Person does not harm the people.<br/>
Whenever there is no harm done,<br/>
that power flows into the common Virtue.<br/>
