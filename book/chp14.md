Look at it, you cannot see it. It is invisible.<br/>
Listen to it, you cannot hear it. It is inaudible.<br/>
Reach for it, you cannot grasp it. It is intangible.<br/>

These three qualities are unfathomable<br/>
and so they fuse together and become one.<br/>

The upper part is not bright.<br/>
The lower part is not dark.<br/>
Ceaselessly the Unnamed moves back to nothingness.<br/>
It has the form of the formless,<br/>
the image of the imageless.<br/>
It is indefinable and shadowy.<br/>
Go up to it and you will not see its front.<br/>
Follow it and you will not see its back.<br/>

Yet, hold fast to this ancient Tao<br/>
and you will experience the present now-moment.<br/>
Know its beginnings and you can follow the path of the Tao.<br/>
