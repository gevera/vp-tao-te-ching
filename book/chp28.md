Develop the strength of a man, but live as gently as a woman.<br/>
Become a brook and receive all things under heaven.<br/>
If you are such a brook then Virtue will constantly flow into you<br/>
and you will become a simple child again.<br/>

Know the pure but live the life of the sullied.<br/>
Become a fountain to all things under heaven.<br/>
If you become such a fountain<br/>
then you will have abundant Virtue<br/>
and you will return to the state of the Uncarved Block.<br/>

When the Uncarved Block is cut up into pieces,<br/>
it is turned into specialised instruments.<br/>
But the True Person makes use of it whole<br/>
and becomes the master of the instruments.<br/>

Hence, it is said, “The finest carver cuts little.”<br/>
