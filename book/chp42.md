The Tao gives birth to the One.<br/>
The One gives birth to two.<br/>
Two gives birth to three.<br/>
And three gives birth to the ten thousand things.<br/>

The ten thousand things have their backs in the shadow<br/>
while they embrace the light.<br/>
Harmony is achieved by blending the breaths of these two forces.<br/>
People dislike the words “alone,” “helpless,” “worthless,”<br/>
yet this is how Princes describe themselves.<br/>

So it is that sometimes a thing is increased<br/>
by being diminished and diminished by being increased.<br/>

What others teach I also teach:<br/>
“A violent person will not die a natural death.”<br/>
I shall make this the basis of my teaching.<br/>
