A person whose courage lies in daring will meet death.<br/>
A person whose courage lies in not daring will encounter life.<br/>
Of the two courses, either may be beneficial or harmful.<br/>

Heaven dislikes what it dislikes.<br/>
Who knows the reason why?<br/>
Even the True Person has difficulty with such a question.<br/>

The Tao of Heaven<br/>
does not strive and yet it overcomes,<br/>
does not speak and yet it gets responses,<br/>
does not beckon and yet it attracts,<br/>
is at ease and yet it follows a plan.<br/>

The net of heaven is cast wide.<br/>
Though the mesh is coarse, nothing ever slips through.<br/>
