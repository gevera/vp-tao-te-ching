For governing others and serving heaven<br/>
there is nothing better than moderation.<br/>
A person who is moderate returns to the path.<br/>
Returning to the path brings an abundance of Virtue.<br/>
This good store of Virtue cannot be conquered.<br/>
Virtue that cannot be conquered knows no limit.<br/>
Only a person who has limitless Virtue is fit to lead.<br/>
Only the leader who possesses the Mother of the country will long endure.<br/>
This is called making the roots go deep by restraining the trunk.<br/>
Learn to focus your life and you will see many days.<br/>
