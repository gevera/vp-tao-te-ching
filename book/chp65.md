The ancients who practised the Tao<br/>
did not use it to enlighten the people,<br/>
but rather to assist them in gaining simplicity.<br/>
The reason people are difficult to govern<br/>
is because they are too clever.<br/>

Hence, a person who attempts to govern a country by cleverness will injure it.<br/>
Those who govern without cleverness will be a blessing to the land.<br/>
These are the two models.<br/>
Knowing these models is called the Mystic Virtue.<br/>
The Mystic Virtue is deep and so far-reaching<br/>
that it can lead all things back toward great harmony.<br/>
