The ancient followers of the Tao<br/>
were subtle, mysterious, and penetrating.<br/>
They were too deep to be fathomed.<br/>
All we can do is describe their appearance.<br/>
Hesitant, as if crossing a winter stream.<br/>
Watchful, as if aware of neighbours on all sides.<br/>
Respectful, like a visiting guest.<br/>
Yielding, like ice beginning to melt.<br/>
Simple, like an Uncarved Block.<br/>
Open, like a valley.<br/>
Obscure, like muddy water.<br/>

Who else can be still and let the muddy water<br/>
slowly become clear?<br/>
Who else can remain at rest and slowly come to life?<br/>

Those who hold fast to the Tao<br/>
do not try to fill themselves to the brim.<br/>
Because they do not try to be full<br/>
they can be worn out and yet ever new.<br/>
