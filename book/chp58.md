When the government is unseen the people are simple and happy.<br/>
When the government is lively the people are cunning and discontented.<br/>

On misery perches happiness.<br/>
Beneath happiness crouches misery.<br/>

Who knows when this will cease?<br/>
The straight changes into the crooked.<br/>
The good becomes the ominous.<br/>
Surely the people have been confused for a long time.<br/>

Therefore, the True Person squares without cutting,<br/>
carves without hacking,<br/>
straightens without dislocating,<br/>
gives forth light without blinding.<br/>
