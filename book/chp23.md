To talk little is to follow nature.<br/>

A whirlwind does not last all morning.<br/>
A sudden shower does not last all day.<br/>
Who produces these things?<br/>
Heaven and earth!<br/>
Even heaven and earth cannot make<br/>
wild things last long.<br/>
How then can people hope to do so?<br/>

People of the Tao conform to the Tao.<br/>
People of Virtue conform to Virtue.<br/>
People who lose the way conform to the loss.<br/>
Those who conform to the Tao are welcomed into the Tao.<br/>
Those who conform to Virtue are welcomed into Virtue.<br/>
Those who conform to the loss are welcomed into the loss.<br/>

Those who do not trust enough will not be trusted.<br/>
